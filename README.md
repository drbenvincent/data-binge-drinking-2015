# data-binge-drinking-2015

This dataset was collected by Maeve Hanvey for her undergraduate dissertation project (2015-16), supervised by Dr Ben Vincent at the University of Dundee.

This is essentially a correlational study, designed to explore the relationship between alcohol consumption habits and delay discounting (aka temporal discounting). We have `N = 35` participants (before any exclusion), and for each, we have a set of measures relating to alcohol consumption, and a set of measures relating to delay discounting behaviour.

## Files
The main data is presented in 2 tab-delimited `.csv` files.
- `binge-discounting.csv` contains participant information and binge-drinking measures.
- `parameterEstimates_Posterior_median.csv` contains delay discounting measures, this file is automatically generated by computerised scoring of the delay discounting toolbox (see Vincent, 2016).

Other files:
- `discounting_raw_data/` is a folder containing raw response data for the delay discounting task, for each participant.
- `score_discounting_responses.m` is a Matlab script used to score the raw delay discounting data, resulting in the measures `m` and `c`, see below.

## Variables in `binge-discounting.csv`

- `ID`
- `sex`
- `age`

The following variables are obtained from the alcohol timeline followback questionnaire.
- `drinking_days`
- `binge_days`
- `total_units`
- `mean_units_per_session` is a derived quantity, equal to `total_units / drinking_days`

The following variable was a special-purpose score we constructed to capture level of binge drinking.
- `binge score`

## Variables in `parameterEstimates_Posterior_median.csv`
All participants completed a delay discounting task, indicating choices between immediate (hypothetical) monetary rewards vs larger but later rewards. Each trial resulted in a binary choice (for smaller sooner, or larger later reward). The raw data was then scored using the toolbox described by Vincent (2016): we estimated a how a participant's discount rate (according to the hyperbolic discount function) varied as a function of reward magnitude:

    log(k) = m.log(|reward|) + c

This scoring procedure resulted in the following temporal discounting measures:

- `m` describes the slope of log discount rate as a function of log reward magnitude. If `m=0` then the size of a monetary reward has no effect upon the discount rate. When `m<0` it means discount rates decrease as rewards get larger. In other words, people get less impulsive when it comes to obtaining larger amounts of money.
- `c` can be seen as a baseline level of discounting.

This analysis was conducted using `score_discounting_responses.m`. I used a hyperbolic discounting model, which also accounts for the magnitude effect. Because we do not have multiple participant groups or conditions, we subjected all participant data to group-level hierarchical analysis.
